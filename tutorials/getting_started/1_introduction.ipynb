    "# Introduction to FBL: Part 1: Fundamentals of the Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial series, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of using FlyBrainLab (FBL) as a platform for exploration of and research on *Drosophila* neural circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this *introductory* tutorial series, we will cover several capabilities of FlyBrainLab. Namely, we will look at, in order,\n",
    "* **1.** Fundamentals of the Platform and Workspace Creation (This file),\n",
    "* **1.(b)** Querying *Drosophila* Databases [(1b_nlp_queries.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/getting_started/1b_nlp_queries.ipynb),\n",
    "* **1.(c)** Operating with query results [(1c_query_results.ipynb)](1c_query_result.ipynb),\n",
    "* **2.** Creating Scripts and Accessing the FlyBrainLab Client [(2_scripts.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/getting_started/2_scripts.ipynb),\n",
    "* **3.** Retrieving and Visualizing Connectivity for a Queried Circuit [(3_connectivity.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/getting_started/3_connectivity.ipynb),\n",
    "* **4.** Accessing Queried Circuits using Python Graph Libraries (NetworkX) [(4_networkx.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/getting_started/4_networkx.ipynb),\n",
    "* **5.** Saving and Retrieving Explored Circuits [(5_exploration.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/getting_started/5_exploration.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of our of tutorials (*intermediate* level) which can be accessed in any order, we cover topics such as\n",
    "* Diagram Generation from Explored Circuits [(generate_diagram.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/diagram_generation_tutorial/generate_diagram.ipynb),\n",
    "* Retrieving Neuron Information [(neuron_information.ipynb)](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/neuron_information_tutorial/neuron_information.ipynb),\n",

    "\n",
    "Over time, more tutorials may become available; check the list at our [Tutorials](https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/Tutorials) page for up-to-date information. For more information on the platform, we recommend taking a look at our Wiki and specifically the Resources section at https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab/wiki/FlyBrainLab-Resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by creating a FlyBrainLab workspace. You will first want to open this notebook from JupyterLab. Now, you want to go to your **Launcher** panel on top and press the **Create FBL Workspace** button there. You will be asked to select a specific dataset for your workspace. You can use Hemibrain for this spoecific tutorial, but the rest of this series will use FlyCircuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the image below to see how that should look like. If you do not see the FlyBrainLab panel, that means there was an installation error. Go back to the installation guide at https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab for installation instructions and troubleshooting. In addition, note that the FlyBrainLab Wiki, located at https://github.com/FlyBrainLab/FlyBrainLab/wiki, contains a large number of resources in addition to what this series will cover."

To do so, go back to the tutorial notebook, click on the **Python 3** text on the top right, and select the kernel whose name corresponds to the name of your workspace. By default, this will be \"Untitled.ipynb\" or something similar, and will correspond to the name of the tabs that are generated. You can rename the notebook of the workspace by right clicking the name of the notebook and pressing **Rename Notebook...**."

FlyCircuit and Hemibrain versions come with demos that show what is possible using the platform. The NLP queries allow you to add, keep, remove or show specific cell types to filter out or keep specific neurons to explore a circuit you are interested in."
