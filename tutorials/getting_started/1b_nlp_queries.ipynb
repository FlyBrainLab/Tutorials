    "## Query Rules\n",
    "Let us now explain the rules for constructing these queries. Here is an easy way to construct your NLP queries. Your queries should start with a verb; the verbs supported right now are \n",
    "* **show**: clear workspace and then show the queried neurons,\n",
    "* **add**: add to the workspace the neurons queried,\n",
    "* **remove**: remove from the workspace the queried neuron,\n",
    "* **keep**: keep in the workspace only the neurons that meet the criterion of the query,\n",
    "* **hide**: hide the neurons that meet the criterion of the query (this does not remove them from workspace, but reduce their visibility),\n",
    "* **pin**: pin the neurons that meet the criterion of the query. Pinned neurons are automatically highlighted, and cannot be removed by the \"trash can\" button on top of the NeuroNLP window.\n",
    "* **unpin**: unpin the neurons that meet the criterion of the query,\n",
    "* **color**: color the neurons that meet the criterion of the query with a user defined color (can be hex color code, e.g., FF0000 for red), or [these predefined colors](https://github.com/fruitflybrain/ffbo.neuroarch_nlp/blob/master/neuroarch_nlp/data/defaults.py#L2).\n",

    "Next, we explain the rules for defining the criterion of the query, using the verb *show* as an example. The queries will be based on the Hemibrain dataset.\n",
    "* **show *cell-type* neurons**: Shows the neurons of the cell type. Example: \n",
    " - `show PEG neurons`, or simply `show peg`.\n",
    "* **show *\\\\$string\\\\$* neurons**: Shows neurons with a name that contains the string. Example:\n",
    " - `show $PEG$ neurons`, or simply `show $PEG$`, will query any neuron whose name contain the string \\*PEG\\*.\n",
    "* **show */rstring/r* neurons**: Show neurons whose name matches the regular expressing `string` (This requires some knowledge of how the neurons are named in each dataset). Example:\n",
    " - `show /r(.*)PEG(.*)R1(.*)/r neurons`, or simply `show /r(.*)PEG(.*)R1(.*)/r` will show the PEG neurons that innervate PB glomerulus R1.\n",
    "* **show neurons in|that innervate|that arborize in *neuropil/subregion***: Shows neurons that has output or input in a neuropil or a subregion of a neuropil. Examples: \n",
    " - `show neurons in ellipsoid body`, or using abbreviations `show neurons in EB`,\n",
    " - `show PEG neurons that arborize in PB glomerulus r9`.\n",
    " - `show neurons that innervate right al and right mb`. Note that this is different from `show neurons that innervate right al or right mb`.\n",
    "* **show *local* neurons in *neuropil***: Shows the neurons that has only inputs and outputs within the neuropil (note that due to lack of data in some datasets, some neurons are only traced in one neuropil and thus are classified local neuron by default). Examples:\n",
    " - `show local neurons in ellipsoid body`\n",
    "* **show neurons with|that have inputs|outputs in *neuropil/subregion***: More specific then the previous query on the inputs or outputs. Examples:\n",
    " - `show neurons with inputs in AME`,\n",
    " - `show $R3w$ neurons that have outputs in EB`,\n",
    " - `show neurons with inputs in right antennal lobe and outputs in right lateral horn`, or equivalently `show neurons projecting from right antennal lobe to right lateral horn`.\n",
    " - `show neurons that connect right AL and right MB`. Includes both the neurons that has inputs in AL and outputs in MB, and those has inputs in MB and outputs in AL.\n",
    "* **show neurons *presynaptic|postsynaptic to***: Shows the neurons that are presynaptic or postsynaptic to the neurons defined after the word to. Exmples:\n",
    " - `show neurons presynaptic to TuBu05`,\n",
    " - `show $aMe$ presynaptic to KCs that innervate alpha'1 compartment`,\n",
    " - `show DAN postsynaptic to MBONs with at least 30 synapses`,\n",
    "* **show *presynaptic|postsynaptic* neurons**: Shows the neurons that are presynaptic or postsynaptic to the neurons already in workspace. Examples:\n",
    " - `show presynaptic neurons`\n",

    " - `show postynaptic MBON that innervate gamma lobe with at least 5 synapses`\n",

    "Other short-hands:\n",
